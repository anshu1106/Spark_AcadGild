1. What is RDD Lineage?

RDD Lineage is a graph of all the parent RDDs of a RDD. It is built as a result of applying transformations to the RDD and creates a logical execution plan.

2. What is Spark behavior in following Scenario?

Consider a cluster of 100 nodes and your application has 10 transformations. One of the

node fails or disconnects from the cluster during the execution.

A- Spark master or resource manager takes care of redistributing the failed node partition data to some other node.
It creates a new RDD from the partition data and execute the task.

3. How do you control parallelism in applications?

By distributing data across multiple nodes and spawning process to execute tasks on the data

4.4. What is the difference between map and mapPartitions?
RDD.map maps a function to each element of an RDD, whereas RDD.mapPartitions maps a function to each partition of an RDD.
MapPartition is a specialized map that is called only once for each partition. The entire content of the respective partitions is available as a sequential stream of values via the input argument 

5. What are the benefits of Spark Architecture?
a>-Faster batch processing than MapReduce. Spark executes batch-processing jobs 10 to 100 times faster than MapReduce.
b> Spark comes with GraphX, spark streaming, machine learning libraries and spark sql.
c>Apache streaming is suitable for many realtime analytics use cases
d>Supports multiple languages
